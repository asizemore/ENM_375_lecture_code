    "# In class exercise: Coffee spilling\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspired by [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2078152015300377), we ran an experiment to see how much coffee individuals would spill while walking normally (forward) versus walking backward with their coffee. The goal for this exercise is to see if our experiment agrees with the paper's findings that walking backwards will result in less coffee spillage than walking forward."

Next, the individual refilled their coffee to the original height, and walked 5 meters backwards while holding the mug in the same way as in the forward condition.
