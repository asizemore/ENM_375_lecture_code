# Code from lectures in ENM_375


Each lecture has it's own folder. Within the folder for a lecture, we assume the following directry structure:

```
lecture_*X*_*date*
│   *code_file.ipynb*    
│
└───data
    │   *downloaded data goes here*

```


You will need to download the data and add it to the "data" directory in order for the code to run. The necessary data will vary by lecture.


## Lecture-specific instructions


**Lecture 4, January 30th**

Please download the `CCLE_expression.csv` and `sample_info.csv` files from the Dependency Map [website](https://depmap.org/portal/download/). Save both files in a directory titled "data" so that your lecture 4 directory has the same structure as above.


**Lecture 5, February 4th**

This lecture involves an in-class code demonstration, so I will provide the data through Canvas. The data we will use comes from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03520).
