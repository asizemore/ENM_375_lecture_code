# Code from lectures in ENM_375


Each lecture has it's own folder. Within the folder for a lecture, we assume the following directry structure:

```
lecture_*X*_*date*
│   *code_file.ipynb*    
│
└───data
    │   *downloaded data goes here*

```


You will need to download the data and add it to the "data" directory in order for the code to run. The necessary data will vary by lecture.


## Lecture-specific instructions


**Lecture 4, January 30th**

Please download the `CCLE_expression.csv` and `sample_info.csv` files from the Dependency Map [website](https://depmap.org/portal/download/). Save both files in a directory titled "data" so that your lecture 4 directory has the same structure as above.


**Lecture 5, February 4th**

This lecture involves an in-class code demonstration, so I will provide the data through Canvas. The data we will use comes from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03520).


**Lecture 6, February 6th**

The data for all figures in this lecture is included within the notebook. Catan dice rolls from 2016-2019 collected by [Taylor Patch](https://github.com/tcpatch).


**Lecture 7, February 11th**

For this lecture, we use data from [NASA's data portal](https://nasa.github.io/data-nasa-gov-frontpage/) about [bolide reports](https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Fireball-And-Bolide-Reports/mc52-syum), as well as the data from the 2018 [Central Park squirrel census](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw). The in-class exercise will only use the squirrel data.
